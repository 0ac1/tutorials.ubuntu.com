# Upgrade Ubuntu desktop

## Before you start
Duration: 0:01

positive
: We recommend that you backup your existing Ubuntu installation before you update your computer.

Being able to upgrade from one version of Ubuntu to the next is one of Ubuntu's best features. You benefit from the latest software, get security patches and all upgraded technology that comes with a new release without having to resort to reinstallation or re-configuring your system. 

Best of all, upgrading Ubuntu to the next release is easy. As we'll now demonstrate.

If you are upgrading from a version released prior to Ubuntu 15.10, [please read the upgrade notes for more information](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes).

For more recent versions, please read the release notes for [Ubuntu 18.10](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes).

## Launch the Software Updater
Duration: 0:01

Press the **Superkey (Windows key)** to launch the Dash and search for **Update Manager**.

As the application launches it will first check if there are any updates for your current version of Ubuntu that need to be installed. If it does find any, install these first and run *Update Manager* again if you need to restart your machine.

## Check for updates
Duration: 0:01

*Update Manager* will open a window to inform you that your computer is up to date. Click on the **Settings** button to open the main user-interface.

Select the tab called **Updates**, if not already selected. Then set the **Notify me of a new Ubuntu version** dropdown menu to either **For any new version** or **For long-term support versions**, if you're wanting to update to the latest LTS release. You may be asked for your password to make this change. See the [Ubuntu wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS) for details on the differences between standard and LTS releases.

Click on **Close** to be taken back to the update pane and **OK** to close this.

We now need to open *Update Manager* one more time, only this time *Update Manager* will open up and tell you that a new distribution is available. Click **Upgrade** and follow the on-screen instructions.

A message will appear informing you of the availability of the new release. Click **Upgrade** and follow the on-screen instructions.
