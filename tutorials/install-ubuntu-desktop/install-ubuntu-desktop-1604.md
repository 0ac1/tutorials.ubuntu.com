## Getting started
Duration: 0:05

* We recommend you plug your computer into a power source
* You should also make sure you have enough space on your computer to install Ubuntu
* You will need a DVD or USB flash drive with Ubuntu on it, there are [several tutorials](/) that help explain how.

: Tip - if you are installing Ubuntu alongside macOS, you might want to [install refind](http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html) to make choosing your OS at startup easier. You can install it from either macOS or Ubuntu.

## Using a DVD?

It’s easy to install Ubuntu from a DVD. Here’s what you need to do:

1. Put the Ubuntu DVD into the DVD-drive
2. Restart your computer. You should see a welcome screen prompting you to choose your language and giving you the option to install Ubuntu or try it from the DVD.

If you don’t get this menu, read the [booting from the DVD guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD?_ga=2.102380610.2115462233.1496186978-1155966827.1485186360) for more information.

## Using a USB drive?

Most newer computers can boot from USB. You should see a welcome screen prompting you to choose your language and giving you the option to install Ubuntu or try it from the USB.

If your computer doesn’t automatically do so, you might need to press the `F12` key to bring up the boot menu, but be careful not to hold it down - that can cause an error message.

Depending on your previous selections, you can now verify that you have chosen the way in which you would like to install Ubuntu. The installation process will begin when you click the Install Now button.

Ubuntu needs about 4.5 GB to install, so add a few extra GB to allow for your files.
